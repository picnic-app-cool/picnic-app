# Various Flags to control behaviour of the "Labeler"
labelerFlags:
  # If this flag is changed to 'false', labels would only be added when the PR is first created and not when existing 
  # PR is updated.
  # The default is 'true' which means the labels would be added when PR is updated even if they were removed by the user   
  labelOnPRUpdates: true

###### IssueLink Adder #################################################################################################
# Insert Issue (Jira/Github etc) link in PR description based on the Issue ID in PR title.
insertIssueLinkInPrDescription:
  # specify the placeholder for the issue link that should be present in the description
  descriptionIssuePlaceholderRegexp: "^Issue link: (.*)$"
  matchers:
    # you can have several matches - for different types of issues
    # only the first matching entry is replaced
    jiraIssueMatch:
      # specify the regexp of issue id that you can find in the title of the PR
      # the match groups can be used to build the issue id (${1}, ${2}, etc.).
      titleIssueIdRegexp: (GS-[0-9]{1,5})
      # the issue link to be added. ${1}, ${2} ... are replaced with the match groups from the
      # title match (remember to use quotes)
      descriptionIssueLink: "JIRA Ticket: [${1}](https://picnic-app.atlassian.net/browse/GS-${1})"
#    docOnlyIssueMatch:
#      titleIssueIdRegexp: \[(AIRFLOW-X{4})\]
#      descriptionIssueLink: "`Document only change, no JIRA issue`"

###### Title Validator #################################################################################################
# Verifies if commit/PR titles match the regexp specified
#verifyTitles:
  # Regular expression that should be matched by titles of commits or PR
#  titleRegexp: ^GS-[0-9]{1,5}.*$
  # If set to true, it will always check the PR title (as opposed to the individual commits).
#  alwaysUsePrTitle: true
  # If set to true, it will only check the commit in case there is a single commit.
  # In case of multiple commits it will check PR title.
  # This reflects the standard behaviour of Github that for `Squash & Merge` GitHub
  # uses the PR title rather than commit messages for the squashed commit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  # For single-commit PRs it takes the squashed commit message from the commit as expected.
  #
  # If set to false it will check all commit messages. This is useful when you do not squash commits at merge.
#  validateEitherPrOrSingleCommitTitle: true
  # The title the GitHub status should appear from.
#  statusTitle: "Title Validator"
  # A custom message to be displayed when the title passes validation.
#  successMessage: "Validation successful!"
  # A custom message to be displayed when the title fails validation.
  # Allows insertion of ${type} (commit/PR), ${title} (the title validated) and ${regex} (the titleRegexp above).
#  failureMessage: "Wrong ${type} title: ${title}, add JIRA ticket number in the beginning"

####### PR/Branch Up-To-Date Checker ####################################################################################
## Check if the branch is up to date with main when certain files are modified
#checkUpToDate:
#  # The default branch is "main", change the branch if you want to check against a different target branch
#  targetBranch: main
#  files:
#    # File paths that you want to check for
#    # In this example, it checks if the branch is up to date when alembic migrations are modified in the PR.
#    # It helps avoid multiple heads in alembic migrations in a collaborative development project.
#    - airflow/migrations/*
#    - airflow/migrations/**/*
#    - airflow/alembic.ini
